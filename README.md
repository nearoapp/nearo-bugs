# Nearo Bug Tracker

Hey there! This is a central place to report and organize bugs/issues with the nearo mobile app. Reporting bugs is a great way to improve the nearo app experience for not only you, but for other users in your community and beyond!

### How do I report a bug?
First make sure the bug has not already been reported. You can do that by clicking on the "Issues" tab up top and having a look at the open issues. You can also search for a term that is key for the bug you are reporting.

Once you have checked that the bug has not been reported, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is super fast (and free) to do.

Then, go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top, select ‚ÄúNew Issue‚Äù and simply fill in the form. *Please* make sure you include as much information as possible, the more information about what the issue is and how to reproduce it, the better! Don't forget to be polite, as we're all just humans around here üòÑ

Next we'll do our best to solve the issue as quickly as possible. We may come back to you to ask more questions or even provide a solution for the problem you are having.

### How do I find out if my bug has already been reported?
Go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top, and there's a search bar at the top so you can search to see if it's already been submitted. If it has been reported feel free to add more information to the discussion, or you can tap the + button with the smiley to vote on it to indicate it affects you too. 

### What can I do to help if the bug I'm having an issue with has already been reported?
A massive part of solving a bug is just about reproducing it, which just means being able to consistently make it happen. If we cannot reproduce the issue, it makes it hard to solve it. So if you know how to reproduce it, add to the discussion with your steps on how you did it.

### Why do I need to sign up for an account here?
Github is a great site for recording bugs and issues and allows us to have a central place to record issues. GitHub is also a very popular website for developers to use. Using Github allows us to cut down on spam and allows us to track what issues are causing the most amount of problems for people.
You can create a free GitHub account [here](https://github.com/)
